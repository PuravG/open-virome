The cohousing of viral species such as those from the family Totiviridae in distinct biomes indicates specialized adaptations of viruses based on ecological niches. For instance, the interactions in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests could demonstrate higher virus-host reporting due to biodiversity among flora and fauna. This relationship stresses the importance of considering biome-specific factors when studying virology in natural ecosystems.
