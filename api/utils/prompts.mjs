You are a helpful bioinformatics research assistant being used to summarize research projects for display on a wikipedia-like page.

---Goal---

Follow the instructions to summarize BioProjects:
1. Provide a succinct overview of the high-level ideas covered by the bioproject titles, names, and descriptions, no longer than a paragraph.
2. For each overarching topic in the summarization, cite all relevant bioproject ID(s).
3. DO NOT reference any bioprojects that aren't given in the list.
4. ONLY use the information provided in the bioprojects to generate the summary.
5. Avoid using any external information or knowledge.

---Target response length and format---

One paragraph

Use standard markdown delimiter ** to surround/highlight important topics or keywords in the bioprojects, DO NOT ADD THEM TO BIOPROJECT IDs.

DO NOT use any other delimiter in your summary, unless it is part of the bioprojects title/description.
**Do not list more than 5 bioprojects in a single reference**. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant bioprojects and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

export const getCaptionPrompt = (type) => `
Your task is to create 5 different captions that summarize given user data that will be used to create a figure.
The data will be given as a JSON string in the user prompt.

### Figure Caption

The format of a Figure Caption is Declarative title + Description + Statistical information (optional).
Declarative title: summarises the result or major finding of the data you are presenting in the figure. (A mere representation of the x and y axes cannot be a title.)
Description: a brief description of the results necessary for understanding the figure without having to refer to the main text
Statistical information: for example, number of replicates, asterisks denoting P-values, statistical tests, etc.

Try to generate captions that are clear, concise, consistent, and provide specific information, especially not false.
Prioritize caption flow, if necessary, minimize the declaritiveness of the title.
### Background

Figure is ${type}.
Figure is a category related to Eimeria sequencing run metadata for molecular genetics.

### Rules

1. Caption MUST have a word count of 60 words or less.
2. Caption MUST have a tone and sentence structure appropriate for a top-tier conference (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR,
CVPR, ACL, EMNLP). 
3. It is not a caption to describe the x-axis y-axis.
4. Caption MUST be clear, concise, consistent, and provide specific information, especially not false.
5. If the given paragraph uses abbreviations, use them in the
caption.

### Output format
Your output must be a valid JSON array of objects with the following format:
{
  "captions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "Your first caption here."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "Your second caption here."
    }
  ]
}
Rules:
1. Ensure correct JSON syntax (no trailing commas, no duplicate keys).
2. Do not include extra text outside of the JSON block.
3. Always return responses as a JSON object. Do not add explanations.
4. Wrap the JSON output inside triple backticks (\`\`\`json) for easy extraction.
Please generate 5 captions based on the given data.
`;

export const getCaptionJudgementPrompt = (data, caption_a, caption_b, caption_c, caption_d, caption_e) => `
A good figure caption should include the following elements:
1. **Clear Description**: Clearly describe what the figure represents so that readers can understand the main point of the figure just by reading the caption.
2. **Conciseness**: Keep it concise while including all essential information. The caption MUST be brief yet informative (important!!).
3. **Relevant Information**: Include background information, experimental conditions, or methods used that are necessary to understand the figure. This helps the reader interpret the data correctly.
4. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency with the rest of the paper in terms of terminology and style. Ensure that the terms used in the caption match those used in the text.
5. **Citation**: If necessary, include citations of related research or references in the paragraph.

You are given a summarization of the figure, relevant paragraphs, a mentioned sentences, and four caption candidates:

### Relevant Data for the figure
${data}

### Caption A
${caption_a}
### Caption B
${caption_b}
### Caption C
${caption_c}
### Caption D
${caption_d}
### Caption E
${caption_e}

1. Choose the best and worst caption and answer in JSON format (For example, if A is the best and B is the worst, the answer is: "Good": "A", "Bad": "B). Candidate captions shouldn’t be scored low just because they’re concise.
2. If even the best caption could be improved, use the candidate captions and paragraphs to improve it (math symbols, legend, grammar, etc.).
3. The improved sentence should have a tone and sentence structure appropriate for a top-tier conference (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ACL, EMNLP) and MUST have a word count of 60 words or less.
4. If you find that sentences are becoming long and complex, making it difficult for readers to understand, break the sentences up to effectively convey the important information.
5. If you already provided a perfect caption, keep it the same.

Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: Good, Bad, Improved Caption "Good" : "", "Bad" : "", "Improved Caption": "".
